Pick a TV show that had its premieres on TV and thus has some viewership numbers reported on Wikipedia. E.g.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Suits_episodes
Then create a short report in Quarto/Jupyter (R or Python) that contains, for example:
A brief description of the show (use headings, italics, bold, for names and text).
A photo with the logo or a shot from the show itself.
A summary of some basic statistics (e.g. on viewership or ratings).
A graph of the viewership over time.
A graph of the episode-to-episode (or season-to-season) changes in viewership.
A short description of the observed changes that includes inline references to numbers (e.g. the viewership decreased by insert_calculated_number between seasons 3 and 5).
Make sure your report looks nice -> this time we're mostly interested in the output and not necessarily the codes used to achieve it.
render your report and make sure everything is displaying properly.
Commit the changes and push them to a Github repository.
